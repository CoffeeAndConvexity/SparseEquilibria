    ================
    Defender: Same as the usual pursuit evasion game, first two layers are 
              dummy layers, following layers are obtained by unrolling.
    Attacker: We unroll the graph, but introduce max_depth+1 extra 'terminal vertices',
              each of which is tells us how long it took to reach a terminal vertex.

              Let M be the number of vertices in nx_graph_atk (the world graph)
              The first M vertices (i.e., {0, 1, ... M=1}) vertices of each layer 
              corresspond to them. The vertices in {M, M+1, ... M+max_depth-1} are
              terminal vertices for time = {1, , ... max_depth} time that was played
              before reaching the target. Note that the value for depth = 0 
              is required. 
              
              Delayed utilities is typically something like [1, x, x^2 ...x^depth] for 
              some 0 <= x <= 1.
